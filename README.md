## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Google Sheets Connection Failed

**Symptoms**:

- "Permission denied" message

**Solutions**:

1. **Re-authorize Google Sheets**:
   - Go to Integrations → Google Sheets
   - Click "Disconnect"
   - Click "Connect" and re-authorize
   - Ensure you select the correct Google account

2. **Check Spreadsheet Sharing**:
   - Open your Google Sheet
   - Click "Share"
   - Verify "Anyone with the link" or specific email has access
   - Try making it "Editor" level access

3. **Verify Sheet URL**:
   - Ensure URL is in correct format: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SHEET_ID/edit`
   - Copy URL directly from browser address bar
   - Don't use shortened URLs

4. **Check API Quotas**:
   - Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Go to APIs & Services → Quotas
   - Ensure Google Sheets API quota is sufficient
   - Request quota increase if needed

#### Issue 2: Forms Not Filling Correctly

**Symptoms**:
- Form fields remain empty
- Wrong data in fields
- "Unable to identify form fields" error

**Solutions**:

1. **Test Form Recognition**:
   - Go to Agent Settings → "Test Form"
   - Enter target website URL
   - Click "Scan Form"
   - Review detected fields and adjust mapping

2. **Check Form Structure**:
   - Some forms use non-standard HTML
   - Try manually filling form first to understand structure
   - Contact website support if form is JavaScript-heavy

3. **Verify Column Mapping**:
   - Ensure Google Sheet columns match configuration
   - Check that data in columns is correct and complete
   - Look for special characters or formatting issues

4. **Increase Browser Timeout**:
   - Go to Integrations → Browser Automation
   - Increase timeout from 30 to 45-60 seconds
   - Some websites load slowly
   - Save and retry

5. **Enable JavaScript Rendering**:
   - Some forms require JavaScript execution
   - Go to Agent Settings → "Advanced"
   - Enable "Wait for Dynamic Content"
   - Retry form filling

6. **Check AI Model Performance**:
   - If AI is generating incorrect responses
   - Refine the AI prompt in Configuration
   - Provide more specific examples
   - Try different AI model (GPT-4 vs Claude)

#### Issue 3: Emails Not Sending

**Symptoms**:
- "Email send failed" errors
- Emails sent but not delivered

**Solutions**:

1. **Re-authorize Outlook**:
   - Go to Integrations → Outlook
   - Click "Disconnect"
   - Click "Connect" and re-authorize
   - Ensure you use correct Microsoft account

2. **Check Outlook Limits**:
   - Outlook has limit of 2,000 emails/day
   - If reached, wait until next day
   - Reduce batch size or spread over multiple days
   - Check Outlook account for blocks

3. **Verify Email Addresses**:
   - Check that email addresses in Google Sheet are valid
   - Look for typos or malformed addresses
   - Remove test entries (e.g., "test@test.com")

4. **Check Spam Filters**:
   - Emails may be going to spam folder
   - Add your sender email to contacts
   - Set up proper email authentication (SPF, DKIM)
   - Ask recipients to check spam folder

5. **Review Email Template**:
   - Go to Agent Settings → Email Templates
   - Check for broken variable names: `{prospect_name}` not `{prospect}`
   - Ensure all variables are defined in column mapping
   - Test with simple template first

6. **Monitor Outlook Account**:
   - Log into Outlook directly
   - Check for security alerts
   - Verify account isn't locked
   - Check for unusual activity notifications
